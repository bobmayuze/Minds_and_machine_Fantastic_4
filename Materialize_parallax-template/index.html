Our team, Wumbo, got together and, with a pile of lego robot parts, built our brave knight to navigate this dark and perilous journey. We also downloaded the necessary programming software, finished the test file to test said software, and began to logically strategize a way for our robot to solve this puzzle and win the game. </p>

          <h4>DAY 2</h4>
          <p class="left-align light">Today we continued on setting up and programming our robot friend so that he may successfully traverse the Wumpus World. Nathan, our programmer, set up the robot in order to upload code to get a wheel to move. Our robot friend was able to turn in circles!! Upon movement, Nathan declared he could have a name. Our brave hero was dubbed Ser Robin. Unfortunately, Ser Robin was not turning well with the set of wheels initially granted him, so Nathan removed said wheels and replaced with a ball bearing for smoother movement. Later, upon discovering that the gyro sensor he had been equipped with did not function as anticipated, Ser Robin was due for a makeover. We still wanted to use the gyro sensor, but until the problem was solved, the light sensors would have to do. While this was happening, Xiaoyi and Bob continued working hard on figuring out the logic behind traversing the Wumpus World. They ran into some difficulties in the specifics of how to logically go about programming, such as whether it would be easier to program for three first or four, finally settling on four. At this point, it is all still a work in progress, but we are getting somewhere! </p>
