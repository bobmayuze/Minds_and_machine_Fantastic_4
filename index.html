          <p class="left-align light">Today we continued on setting up and programming our robot friend so that he may successfully traverse the Wumpus World. Nathan, our programmer, set up the robot in order to upload code to get a wheel to move. Our robot friend was able to turn in circles!! Upon movement, Nathan declared he could have a name. Our brave hero was dubbed Sir Robin. Unfortunately, Sir Robin was not turning well with the set of wheels initially granted him, so Nathan removed said wheels and replaced with a ball bearing for smoother movement. Later, upon discovering that the gyro sensor he had been equipped with did not function as anticipated, Sir Robin was due for a makeover. We still wanted to use the gyro sensor, but until the problem was solved, the light sensors would have to do. While this was happening, Xiaoyi and Bob continued working hard on figuring out the logic behind traversing the Wumpus World. They ran into some difficulties in the specifics of how to logically go about programming, such as whether it would be easier to program for three first or four, finally settling on four. At this point, it is all still a work in progress, but we are getting somewhere! </p>

          <p class="left-align light">Today Xiaoyi continued to work on the logic behind navigating the Wumpus world, creating different logic flow charts and testing them for their accuracy. Nathan began and continued designing his own program to get the robot to move in the way we need it to. After coming up with a piece of the program, Nathan placed Sir Robin on the Wumpus board, then discovered that it moved in the opposite way he wanted/expected it to, requiring him to reanalyze his work and correct for this mistake. Bob started work on this beautiful website you are currently reading off of. Then, more problems with Sir Robin! The program was not functioning properly and then the unit itself stopped working, and we had to do a hard restart in order to shut it down. Then, after reprogramming some of the code, Sir Robin was able to travel continuously in a straight line. Then he wouldn't turn off again, and a forced shutdown was required. </p>

          <h4>DAY 4</h4>
          <p class="left-align light">Today we really needed to start cracking down and get the movement of the robot complete. Nathan went to work on the code trying to figure out how to get the robot to move in a figure 8 pattern on the board in order to know not only that our code works, but also that the robot was able to move adequately according to that code. Xiaoyi continued working hard on the logic so that could be down flat in order to apply that to the code and eventually layer it over the movement. The website continued to come together so that we could report our findings and experiences in this challenge. Nathan faced some difficulty configuring the sensors so that both sensors worked effectively. Both teams ended up working simultaneously on the Wumpus map trying to figure out how to move their respective robots in the easiest and most effective way. There was the problem as to how to code the robot to use these light sensors in order to cover all potential scenarios of the robot's orientation within the game. Nathan figured out a way for the robot to correct itself by orienting itself correctly based on the location of the lines by lining up the sensors on the line before continuing moving forward.  </p>

          <p class="left-align light">Now it is time to start programming the logic! Today was a short and optional day where we chose to come together for as long as we could to get as much done as possible. We figured out how to share our code with each other through GitHub with Bob being the main man who merges all the code together into one. We placed Sir Robin on the board to see if he can still move in the way that was accomplished when we last met. He was unable, so Nathan made sure to solve that problem before he had to leave for another meeting. Xiaoyi started figuring out how to go about putting the logic into C in a way for the robot to be able to process and understand. The work on the website continued as we tried to figure out how best to orient all the information in a way that is both easy to navigate and aesthetically pleasing.</p>

          <h4>DAY 6</h4>
          <p class="left-align light">Today is our last day in the lab, so a lot of things needed to get done. It’s time to get everything finished up and ready for the competition on Thursday. Sir Robin still isn't moving in the ideal fashion, as it keeps running over lines and not orienting itself properly within the squares, so that was something that needed to be fixed. The logic still needs to be programmed, uploaded into the robot, and tested. Nathan keeps placing the robot on the board to practice and test the different movements. Sir Robin didn’t appear to be responding to the movement input correctly, he would respond to one input and then stop rather than continuing movement according to further inputs. Also, when moving backwards the robot would continue movement rather than stopping where it was supposed to stop. Nathan started testing different distances with the robot while Xiaoyi continued to work hard on programming the logic into C. Nathan solved how to get the robot to move correctly with a left movement, correcting itself on the lines and moving within the squares. However, the robot still did not move correctly with the right movement, moving all over the board and seeming confused on where it was supposed to go or what it was supposed to be doing. Upon testing it again, it worked! It was further diagnosed that the sensors were too low causing for some messed up input upon crossing the lines, causing the robot to move in those random ways. Once that was solved, there was still a function that kept running twice, causing the robot to move beyond where it was supposed to. After some modifications, the robot started moving perfectly. Now it was time to put in the logic! </p>

          <h4>Sir Robin’s Adventures through the World of Wumpus</h4>
          <p class="left-align light">The first mission Sir Robin faced was simple: there was one hole, one Wumpus, and one pile of gold. He moved smoothly through the board, gracefully accepting and interpreting the inputs and moving nicely between squares. He only ever got slightly off, but he made such tight turns and nice adjustments that it was never a problem. He even ended up near the Wumpus, turned, killed it, and moved on to get the gold. Upon acquiring the gold he moved home smoothly and without any issues. He was the only robot of all the groups to do this so well. Success for Sir Robin!! </p>
          <p class="left-align light">The second mission Sir Robin faced there were two holes, a wumpus, and a pile of gold. This one Sir Robin transgressed in much the same almost flawless way, finding the gold and making his way home in a mere 45 seconds! Success for Sir Robin again! Things were looking good for Sir Robin, showing up the rest of the robots who got all sorts of turned around on their adventures. Some couldn't find their way home, others couldn't line up themselves on the board, for some the code wouldn't work at all, but Sir Robin had none of these problems. Where many robots got lost and got into an endless loop, he found his way easily. He was looking to be a mighty successful gold finder and Wumpus hunter!</p>
          <p class="left-align light">On the third and hardest map, Sir Robin’s reputation was untainted. He moved through the board, having one hiccup when one of his sensors overlapped a different line when he was adjusting, causing for him to get confused and stop. However, upon minor adjustment he fixed himself and moved through the rest of the maze with little issue. He shot the Wumpus, but then shot again even after killing it without an arrow, before moving and finding the gold. Upon acquiring the gold, he moved back to the start without error. Success for Brave Sir Robin! What a great gold hunter he turned out to be!</p>
          <p class="left-align light">If we were to do this again, we would probably make the turns of the robot tighter so that he wouldn’t run into the problem where he overlapped the line and had to be adjusted. That way, he would stay exactly in the center of the square and be able to move more smoothly through the maze. However, he did quite well with the turns he had with only one small minor hiccup.</p>
