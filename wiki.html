          <h3>About Sir. Robin</h3>
          <h4>Meet Sir. Robin</h4>
          <p class="left-align light">Sir Robin is a humble lego robot formed of parts from the lego mindstorms set provided to us at the start of the project. He was designed not only with optimal functionality in mind, but also maximum aesthetic within that functionality. When first putting Sir Robin together, we debated using tank tracks to maximize aesthetic, but realized that the functionality would not work as well in regards to turning, so we went with a set of wheels to be moved by the motors, placed on either side of the EV3 processing unit, which makes up the body of the robot. On the other end we placed a ball bearing for smoothest movement in all directions needed. When he needed to turn, one of the main wheels would turn one direction, while the other would stay put, swinging the robot around in place with the ball bearing following this movement smoothly, and keeping the robot in balance. On the front before the wheels, evenly placed collinearly on each end, were the light sensors which allow the robot to know when it was about to cross the line from one square to another. These were placed on the very front of the robot so that the robot would know before it crossed into the next square that it needed to stop. All extended pieces of the robot were braced with long lego pieces and pins to hold them in place. We made sure to place the wires from the motors and sensors to the base EV3 unit in a way such that they were out of the way and did not conflict with Sir Robin’s movement. Black feet extrude from the back on either end of the ball bearing to correct the angle of the sensors and balance the robot.  </p>
          <h4>How he did it</h4>
          <p class="left-align light">The logic works like this. For every block, there are possible values for it and there is exact one real value for it. And when the robot move to a block, the first thing it does is to mark the block adjacent to it. If it does not sure what’s in that block, it will give it a possible value. If it is confident about what’s in the block, it will directly give it the real value and empty all the possible values of that block. After it marks the adjacent blocks, it will first check whether it knows where the gold is already or not. If it knows the position of the gold, it will calculate a safe path to the gold, and then calculate a safe path to go home. If it has not known where the gold is yet, it will move depends on the signal. If the signal indicates that all adjacent blocks are safe, it will move forward and then gets another signal. If the signal indicates that there may be one or more holes near it, the robot will move to a safe block that it hasn’t visited yet. If the signal indicates that there is a Wumpus adjacent to it, it will check whether it knows where the Wumpus is or not, if the robot knows, it will move to the wumpus and shoot it. If it still has no idea about the Wumpus, it will move to the safe block that it hasn’t visited yet as well. For all other signals, the robot does the same thing, first check the gold, then check the Wumpus, and if it has no idea where the gold or Wumpus is, move to a safe block to get the next signal. Finally, if the robot get the signal that says it is standing on the gold, it will calculate a safe path to go home.</p>

          <h4>Is Sir Robin Intelligent? </h4>
          <p class="left-align light">The question of what makes something intelligence is something that has been debated back and forth by philosophers for centuries, and has come to light especially now in an age of such advanced technology and digital media. Is a computer, with its vast knowledge and computing power, intelligent by our definition? Or is intelligence more than that? If we went by computing power and raw facts, then humans would be nothing up to the computer I am currently typing this on, but when it comes to application of these facts in a real world environment, this computer is next to useless without a human to utilize it for such needs. This is where the question of consciousness starts to trickle into the definition of intelligence. Does something need to have consciousness in order to be intelligent? What exactly is consciousness? Are the two codependent? In order to define one we must define the other. </p>
          <p class="left-align light">So by any well accepted definition, intelligence is much more than raw facts and computing power. Rather, it lies in the understanding of those facts and the ability to apply them to the environment or surroundings, which suggests consciousness. Consciousness is, in a simplistic definition, awareness and understanding of the self and one's surroundings. So in order to be intelligent, it suggests that something must be conscious.</p>
          <p class="left-align light">Sir Robin is a robot that we have programmed to receive input about its “surroundings”, interpret this input using programmed logic, then move according to the movement code we also programmed in there. As you can see, there is a lot of programming involved. More specifically, us programming it to know what to do and how to do it. Does that mean the robot is not intelligent? We as humans are also “programmed” by our caretakers and our surroundings, but unlike Sir Robin we are able to independently come to our own conclusions and make decisions based on these conclusions. Sir Robin is able to make decisions we programmed him to make based off of conclusions that are specifically fed to him; he doesn't act independently or according to his own interests and well-being.  </p>
          <p class="left-align light">Therefore, Sir Robin cannot be conscious by the definition that he is not truly aware of himself and his environment and he cannot be intelligent in that he cannot understand and process this environment or apply his conclusions of such in an independent sense. </p>

          <h4>The Wumpus World</h4>
          <p class="left-align light">The perilous World of Wumpus is a dark and dangerous grid of four by four squares that must be trespassed in order to acquire the gold hidden somewhere amongst holes and a ravenous Wumpus monster, with each of these items being in a square on the grid. Fortunately for our hero, there is only one of these items per square, and some squares contain none of these items, making them completely safe for passage. Our hero will start in the lower left square of the board facing up, with the goal of making it to the gold and returning safely. He is equipped with one arrow with which he can kill the wumpus and move safely through the square.</p>
          <p class="left-align light">But however will a hero be able to navigate through pitch darkness in order to find the gold and make it back?! Fortunately, our hero is equipped with senses that will allow for him to observe his surroundings. Whenever he is in a square adjacent to a Wumpus, our hero smells a horrible smell, indicated by a 2. When he is next to a hole, he feels a small breeze, indicated by a 1. When he is next to gold, he sees a glitter, indicated by a 4. Whenever he is next to multiple squares, he gets multiple inputs, and the numbers add up. For example, if he is next to a pit and a wumpus, he will get the input of a 3. However, he doesn't get increased input. That is, if he is next to multiple pits, he only feels a breeze, an input of 1, there is no increase in the breeze. </p>
          <p class="left-align light">So there are two goals for the hero in order to succeed at his quest: make it to the gold, and make it back without falling into a pit or running into the Wumpus. </p>
          <p class="left-align light">So how did our brave Sir Robin do it? </p>
